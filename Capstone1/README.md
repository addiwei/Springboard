# Project Title

Predicting Virality of Youtube Videos 

## Features of the Project
1. Supervised learning problem to predict whether a youtube video is a viral video.
2. Includes preprocessing, EDA, and modeling of both numeric and text data
3. Logistic Regression, SVM, Stochastic Gradient Descent, KNN, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting Classifier, XGBoost
4. Count and density based features of text data, bag of words, stemmed, stop words, and W2V is utilized


### Intended Audience
1. Beginner to intermediate machine learning enthusiasts interested in learning how to tackle a machine learning project from start to finish.  


### Getting Started / Requirements
1. Requires Python (at least 3.0), Jupyter Notebook, Python machine learning libraries (scikit learn, pandas, numpy, stats, matplotlib, seaborn, etc.) 
2. Copy all of the jupyter notebooks, including youtube data file "youtube1000.csv" on to your local machine into a single folder.
3. Run all of the notebooks in order from 2,3,4,5,6.  Notebook number 1 does not need to be run because it's the API code to collect the data.  You can use notebook 1 to collect more data.  
Note: Notebooks that are labeled "modeling", will take a long time to run - this is normal and run time is dependent on hardware.
