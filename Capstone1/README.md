# Project Title:  Predicting Virality of Youtube Videos 

## Features of the Project
1. Supervised learning multiclassification problem to predict whether a youtube video is viral.
2. Includes preprocessing, EDA, feature selection, and modeling of both numeric and text data using feature union / pipelines.
3. Logistic Regression, SVM, Stochastic Gradient Descent, KNN, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting Classifier, XGBoost.
4. Utilizing count and density based features of text data, bag of words, stemmed, stop words, and W2V.


### Intended Audience
1. Beginner to intermediate machine learning enthusiasts interested in learning how to tackle a machine learning project from start to finish.  

### Included Files
1. Final Presentation on the Project
2. FInal Report on the Project
3. Jupyter notebooks:
    Jupyter Notebook 1 - Collecting data via Youtube API
    Jupyter Notebook 2 - Numeric data preprocessing, visualization, hypothesis testing on correlation
    Jupyter Notebook 3 - Modeling on the numeric data exclusively
    Jupyter Notebook 4 - Text data preprorcessing, visualization, feature evaluation / selection
    Jupyter Notebook 5 - Modeling on the text data exclusively
    Jupyter Notebook 6 - Combined modeling on numeric + text data
4. youtube data file (1000 rows of data) 

### Getting Started / Requirements
1. Requires Python (at least 3.0), Jupyter Notebook, Python machine learning libraries (scikit learn, pandas, numpy, stats, matplotlib, seaborn, etc.) 
2. Copy all of the jupyter notebooks, including youtube data file "youtube1000.csv" on to your local machine into a single folder.
3. Run all of the notebooks in order from 2,3,4,5,6.  Notebook number 1 does not need to be run because it's the API code to collect the data.  You can use notebook 1 to collect more data.  
Note: Notebooks that are labeled "modeling", will take a long time to run - this is normal and run time is dependent on hardware.
